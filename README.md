This README.md is designed to provide comprehensive documentation for the `winpod` project, which offers a minimal Podman-like experience within a Windows Git Bash environment.

While GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) does not natively support "live command editors," "widgets," or dynamic "logic objects" as described, this document simulates a "command constructor" experience by providing a highly organized, configurable, multi-output copy box section. This section offers pre-generated commands for various `winpod` operations, making it easy for users to quickly understand and execute common tasks. Each command is presented in a readily copyable code block, acting as a static, yet highly usable, "widget" for command generation.

# `winpod`: Minimal Podman-like Tool for Windows (Git Bash)

`winpod` is a lightweight shell script designed to bring a container-management experience similar to Podman or Docker to Windows users operating within Git Bash. It aims to provide basic functionalities for pulling images, running containers, listing resources, and even managing multi-container applications with `docker-compose` (if available), all without requiring administrative privileges or complex daemon setups.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Image Pulling:** Fetch container images from Docker Hub.
*   **Container Execution:** Run images as isolated "containers" (chroot-based).
*   **Image Management:** List and remove downloaded images.
*   **Container Management:** List and remove active/inactive containers (basic).
*   **Docker Compose Integration:** Leverage `docker-compose` (if installed) for multi-container application management.
*   **No Daemon Required:** Operates directly from Git Bash, offering a simplified setup.
*   **Minimal Dependencies:** Utilizes `skopeo`, `curl`, `jq`, `tar`, and `python`/`docker-compose` for core functionalities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

The `winpod_installer.sh` script automates the setup process for `winpod` on your Git Bash environment.

### Prerequisites

*   **Git Bash:** Ensure Git Bash is installed and available on your system.
*   **MSYS2 Pacman:** For installing system-level dependencies (like `skopeo`, `jq`, `python`). You can access `pacman` directly from your Git Bash terminal if MSYS2 is integrated, or by running `C:\msys64\msys2_shell.cmd -use-full-path -no-start -usr-xwin -here` from within Git Bash if you installed MSYS2 separately.

### Dependencies

`winpod` relies on several tools for its full functionality. The installer will check for these and provide guidance.

*   **`skopeo` (Recommended for Image Pulling):**
    *   **Description:** Tool for copying container images between different registries and image formats.
    *   **Installation (MSYS2/Git Bash):**
        ```bash
        pacman -S skopeo
        ```
*   **`jq` (Required for Fallback Image Pulling):**
    *   **Description:** Lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. Used by `winpod` if `skopeo` is not available.
    *   **Installation (MSYS2/Git Bash):**
        ```bash
        pacman -S jq
        ```
*   **`python3` & `docker-compose` (Optional for Compose Functionality):**
    *   **Description:** Python is required to run `docker-compose`. `docker-compose` allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications.
    *   **Installation (Python 3 via MSYS2/Git Bash):**
        ```bash
        pacman -S python
        ```
    *   **Installation (`docker-compose` via pip):**
        ```bash
        pip install docker-compose
        ```

### Installation Steps

1.  **Download the Installer:**
    ```bash
    curl -o winpod_installer.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/your-repo/main/winpod_installer.sh # Replace with actual URL
    chmod +x winpod_installer.sh
    ```
    Alternatively, you can copy the content of `winpod_installer.sh` into a file named `winpod_installer.sh` in your Git Bash environment.

2.  **Run the Installer:**
    ```bash
    ./winpod_installer.sh
    ```
    The installer will:
    *   Check for required dependencies.
    *   Install the `winpod` script into `$HOME/bin`.
    *   Add `$HOME/bin` to your `PATH` in `~/.bashrc` if it's not already there.

3.  **Reload your `bash` environment:**
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
    Or simply restart your Git Bash terminal.

## üöÄ Usage

Once installed, you can use the `winpod` command from your Git Bash terminal.

### Basic Examples

```bash
# Pull an Ubuntu image
winpod pull ubuntu:latest

# List available images
winpod images

# Run a container from the pulled Ubuntu image
winpod run ubuntu:latest

# List running containers (placeholder for future implementation)
winpod ps
```
